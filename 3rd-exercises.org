* Fuzzy Question

  Investigate and report on some application of *fuzzy sets* and *fuzzy logic*.

** Answer

Set A is the set of all the places in the world that I want to
travel. Set B is the set of all the things I can actually do this
week. Getting all my homework done is membership of 1. Going to work
has membership 1.  Getting a new phone has membership .5, though it
probably should have membership 1. 

In Fuzzy Logic everything matters to a degree. 

A set of fuzzy logic rules can look like this:
IF in a debate, the speaker is interesting to listen to then he wins the debate. 
IF the speaker has some very strong arguments then he wins the debate.
IF the speaker is unable to put his point across then he loses the debate.
