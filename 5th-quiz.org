These are some questions about Cantor Diagonalization, Diophantine
Equations, and Continued Fractions.

* 1st Question

  The function \(Table(i, j) = ((i - 1)/2^{j - 1}) \% 2\) is useful
  for filling out the table in the Cantor Diagonalization argument
  showing that the cardinality of the power set of the set of positive
  integers is uncountably infinite, because it allows the table
  filling to happen in a very systematic way.

  What is the digit at \(Table(13, 3)\)? (Remember that % is the
  modulus operator and that / is doing integer division (truncating
  any fractional part).)

  - [X] 0
  - [ ] 1

* 2nd Question

  In the Cantor Diagonalization argument showing that the cardinality
  of the power set of the set of positive integers is uncountably
  infinite, the following is a function that constructs the \(n^{th}\)
  "diagonal" digit; which digits, taken all at once, are the elements
  of the subset necessarily missing from the supposedly complete list
  of subsets:

  \(Digit(n) = 1 - Table(n, n)\)

  - [X] True
  - [ ] False

* 3rd Question

  Depicted below is the "infinite binary tree". (Naturally, this is
  only a conceptualization of something that cannot actually be
  drawn.) The tree is constructed by letting all possible paths move
  upward, forking infinitely many times. By continually halving
  distances, an infinite number of "branches" (or nodes) will fit
  below the horizontal line. Imagine each point on this line as being
  a "leaf" that lies at the end of one of the infinitely zigzagged
  paths up through the tree. Starting from the bottom (the root of the
  tree) to trace a complete path up to the horizontal line one makes
  an infinite number of Left-Right decisions (Left corresponding to 0
  and Right to 1). For example, the path where the squiggly line meets
  the horizontal line corresponds to the infinite sequence: 0, 1, 1,
  0, 1, .... Starting from the bottom single node, the number of nodes
  at each step doubles as the distance to the horizontal line halves.

  Which of the following statements is true of this tree in its finished form?

  - [ ] It has a countable number of nodes and a countable number of paths.
  - [X] It has a countable number of nodes and an uncountable number of paths.
  - [ ] It has an uncountable number of nodes and a countable number of paths.
  - [ ] It has an uncountable number of nodes and an uncountable number of paths.

* 4th Question

  In 1976, James Jones, Daihachiro Sato, Hideo Wada, and Douglas Wiens
  published the following polynomial:

\(\begin{array}{rcl}
(k + 2)\{(1 &-& [wz + h + j - q]^2\\
            &-& [(gk + 2g + k + 1)(h + j) + h - z]^2\\
  	    &-& [16(k + 1)^3(k + 2)(n + 1)^2 + 1 - f^2]^2\\
	    &-& [2n + p + q + z - e]^2\\
	    &-& [e^3(e + 2)(a + 1)^2 + 1 - o^2]^2\\
	    &-& [(a^2 - 1)y^2 + 1 - x^2]^2\\
	    &-& [16r^2 y^4(a^2 - 1) + 1 - u^2]^2\\
	    &-& [n + l + v - y]^2\\
	    &-& [((a + u^2(u^2 - a))^2 - 1)(n + 4dy)^2 + 1 - (x + cu)^2]^2\\
	    &-& [(a^2 - 1)l^2 + 1 - m^2]^2\\
	    &-& [q + y(a - p - 1) + s(2ap + 2a - p^2 - 2p - 2) - x]^2\\
	    &-& [z + pl(a - p) + t(2ap - p^2 - 1) - pm]^2\\
	    &-& [ai + k + 1 - l - i]^2\\
	    &-& [p + l(a - n - 1) + b(2an + 2a - n^2 - 2n - 2) - m]^2\}\end{array}\)

  This polynomial contains 26 variables (all the letters of the
  alphabet!), and the set of its /positive/ values is exactly the set
  of all prime numbers.

  Given /k/ = 0, find some possible values for /w/, /z/, /h/, /j/,
  /q/, and /g/, that /could/ result in the value 2, the first prime
  number, for the entire polynomial.

* 5th Question

  The code in [[file:../cof/continued-fractions.org][continued-fractions.org]] can theoretically give you the
  first few partial quotients (coefficients) of the *continued
  fraction representation* (CFR) of any positive rational or
  irrational number. Find and compare the CFRs of the square root of 2
  =(sqrt 2.0)= and the rational number \(\frac{1393}{985}\).

** Short Answer
Square root of two with seven iterations:
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |

1393/985 with seven iterations:
| 1 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 |
